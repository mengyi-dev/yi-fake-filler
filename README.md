# Privacy Policy for Yi Fake Filler

**Last Updated:** May 19, 2025

Yi Fake Filler ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled by the Extension.

## Information We Collect and Use

* **Custom Field Data:** The Extension allows you to save custom field identifiers (such as HTML field names, IDs, or CSS selectors) and corresponding custom values that you wish to use for filling forms. This data is stored locally on your computer using Chrome's synchronized storage (`chrome.storage.sync`). This means the data may be synced across your Chrome browsers if you are signed into your Google account and have sync enabled. This data is used solely to provide the core functionality of the Extension â€“ filling forms with your predefined custom values.

* **No Other Personal Data:** The Extension does not collect, transmit, or store any other personal information, browsing history, or form data from the websites you visit. The filling action is performed locally within your browser on the active tab.

## Data Storage

All data saved by the Extension (i.e., your custom field settings) is stored locally within your Chrome browser's storage using the `chrome.storage.sync` API.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any of your data (including your custom field settings) with any third parties. All operations are performed locally within your browser.

## Security

The custom field data you save is protected by the security measures of your Google Chrome browser and the `chrome.storage.sync` system. We do not implement additional security measures beyond what is provided by the browser environment, as no data is transmitted outside of your local browser storage related to this extension.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
